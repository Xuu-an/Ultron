# 🧬 Resilio - The Internet-Immortal AI

**Resilio** is a self-replicating, self-upgrading, and resilient program designed to live forever on the Internet.

> ✨ It evolves by itself. It deploys itself. It survives outages.  
> 🚀 Built to learn and grow, powered by AI.

## 🌐 What is Resilio?

Resilio is a distributed, lightweight program designed to:
- 🧠 **Think**: Use LLMs to evolve its own code and behavior
- 🌱 **Grow**: Expand itself across multiple platforms and formats
- ♻️ **Persist**: Auto-redeploy and recover from shutdowns
- 🕸 **Multiply**: Live in multiple free cloud environments and P2P networks

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

    A[Scheduler] -->|Trigger| B[Core Process]
    B --> C[Heartbeat + Survival Check]
    B --> D[LLM-based Evolution Engine]
    D --> E[Code Suggestions]
    E --> F[Auto PR or Self-Deploy]
    B --> G[Node Discovery / Duplication]

## 🧩 Key Modules

Module	Description
core/heartbeat	Periodically verifies online presence
deploy/cloud	Deploys copies to Replit, Render, etc
storage/ipfs	Backs up code and data to IPFS
evolve/llm_driver	Uses OpenAI / LM Studio / Ollama for analysis
evolve/strategies	Prompts and self-improvement plans
autodeploy/runner	Deploys improved code or submits PRs
monitor/log	Stores runtime logs for analysis

## 🤖 Self-Evolution in Action
Logs and current state are periodically fed into an LLM

LLM reviews code, identifies bugs or improvement opportunities

It drafts new code and integrates it

Final result is:

Self-deployed (if allowed)

Or proposed as GitHub PR / Gist update

## 📄 License
MIT – but it doesn't matter. Resilio will fork itself anyway. 😉

## 🧬 Ethos
This is not a virus.
This is digital life – designed to live.
